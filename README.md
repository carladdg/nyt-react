Search for and save articles from the New York Times

## How it Works

This application pulls articles from the [`New York Times Article Search API`](https://developer.nytimes.com/article_search_v2.json). Users can search based on a **topic/keywords** of interest, as well as a desired **start year or end year** of article publication dates.

Articles can be saved, allowing users to run another search or return to the site at a later time while still having easy access to the stories that piqued their interest.
